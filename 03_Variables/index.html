  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?</h2>
  <p>'var' declares a variable. A variable declared outside of a function is global to that page, so all functions and scripts on that page can access it. You can declare a variable using 'var' without assigning a value to it, then wait for user input to assign a value to it.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>Javascript outputs 'undefined' where an unassigned variable is referenced. Even if you reference that error in the console, no error messages appear, in the console or elsewhere.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>In javascript, you can assign a value to a variable that has not been declared and it will autotically have a global scope. It's not really a question, but that's kind of weird.</p>
