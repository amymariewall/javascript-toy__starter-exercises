//7B: More Counting.

//Prompt the user for a start value and an end value. Count from the start value to the end value using a `while` loop. Make sure to account for the start-value being equal to or greater than the end-value (should it not count? Should it count down instead of up in such cases?).

//Extend this by asking the user what increment they want to count by.

  var i = prompt("Please enter a start-value.");
  var y = prompt("Please enter an end-value.");

while (i <= 10) {

  alert("The number is " + i);
    i++;
}
