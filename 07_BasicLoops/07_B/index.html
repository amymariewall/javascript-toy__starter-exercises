<h2>07B: More Counting</h2>

<h2>Prompt the user for a start value and an end value. Count from the start value to the end value using a `while` loop. Make sure to account for the start-value being equal to or greater than the end-value (should it not count? Should it count down instead of up in such cases?).

Extend this by asking the user what increment they want to count by.</h2>
