<h2>6D: Driver's Ed</h2>

<h2>Prompt the user for their age and store it in a variable, then display any and all applicable messages below:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Age 25 and older: "You can rent a car"</li>
  <li>Age 21 and older: "Please don't drink and drive"</li>
  <li>Age 16 and older: "You're eligible for a driver's license"</li>
  <li>Age 0 - 15: "You can't drive yet, but you'll be able to in a few years"</li>
  <li>Any negative number: "You haven't been born yet"</li>
  <li>NaN: "Sorry, but that's not a number"</li>
</ul>

<h2>For example, if I am 27, I should get the messages for 16, 21, and 25. If I am 23, I should get the messages for 16 and 21, but not 25, 0, or negative.</h2>

<h2>These messages can be displayed as alerts or as logs to the console.</h2>

<h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
<p>Answer.</p>

<h2>When testing ranges, did you use `&&`, `||`, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used `&&`, why is that a better choice than `||` (and vice-versa)?</h2>
<p>Answer</p>

<h2>What types of input produce a value of `NaN` after parsing? Is it important to check for `NaN` values? Is it possible for a `NaN` value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
<p>Answer</p>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
