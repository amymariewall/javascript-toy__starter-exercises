  <h2>Password prompts, comparisons, and alerts.</h2>

<h2>What do you call `true` and `false` values?</h2>
<p>Truthy or falsy, respectively.</p>
<h2>How is `true` similar or dissimilar from `"true"`? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
<p>Super weird that javascript tries to convert the objects on either side of an operand to a another data type. I think if you did "true" == true it would show false because it would convert the boolean true into a number and the string will get converted to nAn. Why doesn't it convert the boolean to a String instead of a number? Not super sure. I'm sure there's a reason. Probably something to do with the nature of booleans.</p>
