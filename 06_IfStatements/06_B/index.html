  <h1>JS Atomic 06B</h1>
  
<h2>Password prompts, comparisons, and alerts.</h2>

<h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
<p>No flexibility in capitalization that I can find.</p>

<h2>Did you use `=` or `==` or `===` to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
<p>I used '=='. '=' would not have worked, or rather the user would have gotten a lot of great job messages. '===' would also have worked assuming your stored password variable doesn't get converted from a String, which apparently javascript does willy nilly so I might be a tad careful.</p>

<h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
<p>It's not, you should put your credit card number, expiration date, and CVV in a js file and let me know what your website URL is. Just kidding it's a terrible idea you can see the js for a page using your browser's view source tool. Quite literally you can click a link to open the js file that is being referenced on a web page.</p>
