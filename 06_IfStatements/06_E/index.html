<h2>6E: Driver's Ed</h2>

<h2>This exercise is pretty similar to Part 1, but in this case you'll *only display one message* depending on the range your user's age falls into:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Age 25 and older: "You can rent a car</li>
  <li>AAge 21 - 24: "Please don't drink and drive"</li>
  <li>Age 16 - 20: "You're eligible for a driver's license"</li>
  <li>Age 0 - 15: "You can't drive yet, but you'll be able to in a few years"</li>
  <li>Any negative number: "You haven't been born yet"</li>
  <li>NaN: "Sorry, but that's not a number"</li>
</ul>

<h2>All of your program logic (i.e. the part that decides which output to display) should be contained in a single `if` / `else if` / `else` block, rather than in separate `if` statements.</h2>

<h2>These messages can be displayed as alerts or as logs to the console.</h2>

<p>You will not need to use `else` or `else if` in this exercise.</p>

<h2>Does it matter what order your `if` / `else if` statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
<p>This should still work fine bacause they are all mutually exclusive in this case, except the final else would have to stay put if I kept it as a plain else catchall without having to check for NaN.</p>

<h2>What's wrong with this conditional: `if (age < 16 && age > 21)`?</h2>
<p>You can't be less than 16 and also greater than 21 unless you have a Peter Pan-like alter ego living on a parallel Universe, which I think all of us probably do, so there isn't anything wrong with that conditional.</p>

<h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your `if` statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
<p>If a variable like 'drinking age' changed in every country, I would probably assign it to a variable to that I only had to change it in one place whenever I implemented this program in a different country.</p>
